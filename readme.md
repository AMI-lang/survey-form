# Here are a couple of CSS changes to make
- change the background color of the input fields
- make the labels bolder
- change the color of the text of the input fields
- Style the 'Submit feedback' button. It should have same width as the input fields. It should have a background color and a border of 2px
- the container of the form should have a box shadow effect (I am looking forward to seeing this ðŸ˜Š)
- give the body of the page a background image
